## **Problem 1**

**Functions and Default Parameters**

Create a TypeScript program that declares a function that takes two parameters, a string and a number. The function should log the string parameter repeated the number of times specified by the number parameter. If the number parameter is not provided, it should default to 3.

---

## Problem 2  ðŸ§¨ðŸ§¨

Write a function that takes in an array of objects with properties `name` and `age`, and returns only the objects where the person's age is greater than or equal to 18,
---

## **Problem 3:**

Create a TypeScript program that uses a generic function to reverse an array of strings, and takes a variable number of strings to the array using rest parameters. Provide an example of calling the function with a variable number of strings.

---


## **Problem 4:**

Create a TypeScript class called `Person` that has private properties name and age, and a public method getDetails that returns a string with the person's name and age. Use parameter properties to define and initialize the properties in the constructor.



Create a TypeScript class called `Student` that extends the Person class and has an additional private property grade. Define a public method getGrade that returns the student's grade. Use the super keyword to call the constructor of the Person class and initialize the name and age properties.

---

## **Problem 5:**

Create a TypeScript function that takes a parameter of type unknown and uses a type guard to check whether the parameter is of type string. If it is, log the string to the console. If it is not, log an error message.

# Optional Problems: 

## optional Problem 1

**Array and Tuple types**

Create a TypeScript program that declares an array of strings and a tuple of a number and a string. Add elements to both data structures, and log them to the console.

---

## **Optional Problem 2:**

Create a TypeScript program that uses a conditional type to create a new type that is either a string or a number, depending on whether a parameter of type string or number is passed to the function. 

Then, create an interface for a person with properties name and age, and use the new type as a constraint on the age property. 

Finally, create an object that satisfies the Person interface and log it to the console.
